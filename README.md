# Overview

## Credit Card Fraudulent Detection

Credit card fraud detection using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and DBSCAN clustering is a powerful approach for identifying fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. This approach involves the use of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns in credit card transactions, and then identifying unusual activities that deviate from normal patterns.

In this approach, the first step is to preprocess and clean the credit card transaction data. Then, relevant features are selected, and the data is divided into training and testing datasets. The ANN model is trained using the training dataset to learn the patterns in the transactions.

Once the ANN model is trained, it can be used to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is then applied to the same dataset to identify clusters of transactions that exhibit similar patterns. The clustering algorithm is used to group transactions based on their proximity in a multi-dimensional feature space. This helps to identify groups of transactions that are similar to each other and different from the rest of the data.

By combining the ANN and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, we can identify fraudulent activities in a more efficient and accurate manner. The ANN model provides a robust classification of transactions, while the DBSCAN clustering algorithm helps to identify unusual groups of transactions that may be indicative of fraudulent activities.

Overall, credit card fraud detection using ANN and DBSCAN clustering is a promising approach for detecting and preventing fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. This approach can help credit card companies protect their customers from fraud and prevent financial loss.
